Directory Tree Python
=====================

It is a Python script for getting a text of the files contained in a directory. 

This is helpful on Windows when you want to store a list of all the files you'll backup in a CD or DVD.

On Linux there is no need for this tool because you can achieve this with:
```
find . -name "*.*"
```

I wrote this tool thinking on Windows users that don't know how to use Power Shell or/and using older Windows versions.

## Requirements:
- Python 2.7

## Usage:
1. Double click on the script **directory_tree.py**
2. Enter the base name of the file [with no extension] where the results will be stored. 
3. Press enter.
4. Two new files will be created, one with .txt extension and another one with .csv extension.
